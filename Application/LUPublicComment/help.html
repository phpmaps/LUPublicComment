	    <p>This Land Use Public Comment application provides the general public and other interested parties the ability to comment on proposed land use cases being heard in their Local Government. It provides 24x7 access to your government organization and typically supplements statutory public notice requirements. In local governments that are using technology during their planning commission, zoning board of appeals, or governing body’s meetings, the online comments can be viewed during the hearing and at the same time residents are commenting in person on the proposal. If technology is not present, a manual report can be created and routed to appropriate staff. </p>
	    <h4><u>Using the Application</u></h4>
	    <p>The Land Use Public Comment application allows users to submit public comments on proposed development plans.  When you hover over a proposed plan, you will see the Case Number, Case Name, and Hearing Date.  If you then click on the plan, the application will display a popup window with the case details.  The application has been configured to only show development plans with a future hearing date.  It does not allow comments to be submitted on development plans with a hearing date in the past.</p>
        <h4><u>Finding an Area of Interest</u></h4>
        <p>There are three primary ways to identify an area of interest. You can interact directly with the map and click on a land use case when you've located it.
